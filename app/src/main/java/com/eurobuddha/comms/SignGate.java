/**
 * SERIAL SIGNING. Only one signing operation from this app may be in flight at a time.
 *
 * Minima signatures are stateful: each key is a tree of one-time (Winternitz) signatures and the node
 * picks the next leaf by reading, incrementing and writing a per-key {@code uses} counter. Two
 * operations signing the same key at once both read the same value and both sign the SAME leaf over
 * DIFFERENT data — a reused one-time signature, which leaks that leaf's private key. Not theoretical:
 * 7 of 64 default keys on a live node were confirmed re-used, witness-exact.
 *
 * AtomiX is unusually exposed to this:
 *   • MainActivity and SwapService each construct their OWN SwapEngine and MinimaHtlc, and most of the
 *     de-duplication guards are instance fields — only CP_LOCKING is static;
 *   • the settlement loop retries claims on a timer with no persistent dedup, so a failing claim
 *     re-signs indefinitely, at double rate whenever both engines are alive;
 *   • its swap identity is deliberately PINNED to one key (so the maker's published key stays
 *     constant), which concentrates every claim, refund and change output onto that single key.
 *
 * Everything that signs must pass through here — the {@code txnsign} sequences in MinimaHtlc AND the
 * bare {@code send} commands in {@link CommsTransport}, because {@code send} signs internally too and
 * is the highest-frequency signer in the app (one per order publish, OTC publish and tombstone).
 *
 * The node has since been fixed to synchronize its own signing, but this gate stays: the app also runs
 * against nodes we don't control, and serialising is correct regardless.
 *
 * Static, so the two engines in this process share one queue. Everything runs on the main thread
 * ({@link NodeApi} funnels every node callback back to it), so no locking is needed.
